# DebugPanel Copy Filter - Unresolved Issues

## Currently Open

No unresolved issues at this time.

## Questions for Future Consideration

1. **Should network request/response pairs be grouped?**
   - Currently they're separate entries (FETCH_REQ + FETCH_RES)
   - Could be useful to show them together in some formats
   - Not in scope for this task

2. **Should filters apply to download as well?**
   - User asked for "copy" specifically
   - Download could benefit from same filters
   - Not in scope for this task

## Completed Resolutions

None yet - task just starting.
